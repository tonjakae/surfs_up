# Surfs Up Analysis

### Resources:
sql light, flask, jupyter

### Overview
I will need to gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. I will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis

## Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June 

#### Step 1 - write a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June.
#### Step 2 - convert the June temperatures to a list.
